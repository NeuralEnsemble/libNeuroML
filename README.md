## pyNeuroML

A related package, **[pyNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuroML/pyNeuroML)** builds on this and provides functionality, scripts and modules for reading, writing, **simulating** and analysing NeuroML2/LEMS models.

pyNeuroML builds on: [libNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML) & [PyLEMS](https://github.com/LEMS/pylems) and wraps functionality from [jNeuroML](https://github.com/NeuroML/jNeuroML).


## Development process for libNeuroML

Most of the work happens in the [development branch](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML/tree/development). That branch is kept up to date with the development branches for [NeuroML 2](https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/tree/development) and related libraries. See https://neuroml.org/getneuroml for an overview of the various NeuroML libraries.

The examples in this section are intended to give in depth overviews of how to accomplish 
specific tasks with libNeuroML.

These examples are located in the neuroml/examples directory and can
be tested to confirm they work by running the run_all.py script.

Making a NeuroML morphology
---------------------------

Loading and modifying a file
----------------------------

Building a 3D network
---------------------

Pynn models
-----------

Synapses
--------

Working with JSON serialization
------------------------

One thing to note is that the JSONWriter, unlike NeuroMLWriter, will
serializing using array-based (Arraymorph) representation if this has
been used.

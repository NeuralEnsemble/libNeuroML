Introduction
============

An overview of the motivation for libNeuroML, and the various scenarios in which such an API can be useful.

NOTE: libNeuroML targets `NeuroML v2.0`_ (described in 
`Cannon et al, 2014 <http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fninf.2014.00079/abstract>`_) not NeuroML v1.8.1 
(`Gleeson et al. 2010 <http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000815>`_).

NeuroML
-------

NeuroML provides an object model for describing neuronal morphologies, ion channels, synapses and 3D network structure.

Any dynamical components (channels, synapses, abstract cell models) in `NeuroML v2.0`_ will have a definition "behind the scenes" in `LEMS`_.
However, all NeuroML files specify is that "element segment will contain element distal with attributes x, y, z,
diameter..." or "element izhikevichCell will have attributes a, b, c...".

For more on NeuroML 2 and LEMS see `here <http://www.neuroml.org/lems_dev>`_.


Serialisations
--------------

The XML serialisation will be the "natural" serialisation and will follow closely the NeuroML
object model. The format of the XML will be specified by the XML Schema definition (XSD file). Note: 
LEMS definitions of NeuroML ComponentTypes (defining what izhikevichCell does with a, b, c...)
and this XSD file (only saying the izhikevichCell element requires a, b, c...) are currently manually kept in line.

Other serialisations have been developed. See:

APIs for accessing NeuroML files
--------------------------------

APIs in any given language (e.g. Java, Python) should be independent of the serialisation format, and be based on the 
NeuroML object model.

Core read/write methods will be here, e.g. read_neuroml(xmlOrHdfFormat), get_cells(), cell.get_segments(), get_populations(), 
get_projections(), cell.add_segment(), cell.getsegments_in_group(grp), add_population(), save_as_xml(), save_as_hdf5(), 
etc. Additional helper methods could be envisioned across the implementations, e.g. cell.retrieveCoordinates(), etc. 

The naming convention of methods will be a thorny issue: Java and Python have their own preferred formats,. The consensus for now is
to allow each of the APIs to develop with the best practices of the specific language (e.g. PEP8 for Python) to get the maximum
benefit and buy in from that user community.


Backends
--------
 
A backend consists of a specific implementation which stores structure of the cells, network, etc. when the
model is loaded in from XML/HDF5. Scenarios for this can include:

A) A language specific object model generated from the NeuroML schema, e.g. Java or Python class hierarchy for Cell, 
Segment, Network, etc. is used to store the data

B) Optimised version of above with certain objects substituted for more optimal representations of data (e.g. a numpy 
array for 3D points)

C) Simulator specific backend, i.e. when add_cell(...) or cell.add_segment() are called, equivalent entities 
in the native simulator are created. Similarly when save_as_xml() is called in the API the native object tree is 
parsed for this information.

Scenario A) above already has an initial implementation in Python (see 
https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML/tree/master/ideas/padraig/generatedFromV2Schema).

Scenario B) would fulfil most people's requirements for a standalone Python API to read/write large data sets of 
cell/network data, and could be build from A.

Scenario C) could be implemented in Python by extending PyNN for multicompartmental simulators, and by hooking 
commands for building networks in libNeuroML (e.g. add_cell(), add_population, create_segment()) to existing or new 
PyNN commands, and similarly parsing the simulator's internally instantiated network with PyNN commands when the 
network needs to be saved to XML/HDF5. This would facilitate running/saving/plotting models on PyNN simulators.
A version of Mike Vella's example file https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML/blob/master/ideas/mike/example.py
would certainly be possible through a libNeuroML+PyNN API like this.


Extensions
----------

The core libNeuroML API should be kept to the minimal set of commands for reading/writing/parsing the object tree.
Extension packages can be built on this (and PyNN) which use this functionality with specific workflows in mind, e.g.
building small networks of multicompartmental neurons with MorphForge, parameter fitting neuron models (Mike Vella's package).

Other packages then can be developed (e.g. for visualisation in 3D, for analysis of morphological or network properties) 
which will be usable on any simulator which supports libNeuroML+PyNN, e.g. NEURON, MOOSE...

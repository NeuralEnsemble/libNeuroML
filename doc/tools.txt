Tools relevant for this initiative
==================================

Below is a list of tools which are built in or use Python and which would benefit from a standard library to access,
modify and save detailed neuronal morphologies. Developers from most of these initiatives are involved with the
libNeuroML project.

Neuronvisio
-----------

PyNN
----

Morphforge
----------

CATMAID
-------

http://www.catmaid.org
We reconstruct neuronal circuits (morphology in 3D, synaptic connectivity) as skeletons, surfaces, volumes in CATMAID.
We want to be able to export the data into an object model (data format), complement it with ion channel distribution of
several types & synaptic mechanisms, and simulate the membrane voltage time series and do virtual current injection etc.
on standard simulators. All of this with a easy-to-use, intuitive Python API in a few lines of code.

NEURON
------

MOOSE & Moogli
-----

http://moose.sourceforge.net

The latest version of MOOSE with a Python interface can be installed as follows:

::

    svn co http://moose.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/moose/moose/branches/dh_branch moose
    cd moose
    make
    cd 

http://moose.ncbs.res.in/moogli/

GENESIS
-------

http://genesis-sim.org/

neuroConstruct
--------------

http://www.neuroConstruct.org
neuroConstruct generates native simulator code for NEURON, MOOSE and other simulators. It would be a great benefit to be
able to generate pure NeuroML descriptions of the model components and run (nearly) identical Python code on these
simulators to load the NeuroML and execute the simulations. This scenario is implemented already for a limited number of
model types by generating PyNN based scripts which can run on NEURON, Brian and NEST.

===========================
HDF Examples already in use
===========================

We would like to collect all the HDF formats already in use out there to have a 
better understanding how to uniform all of this in one shared format. If you have 
one of this example, please add it to the list. If it is possible, please keep 
the file small (<1 Mb). Remember, we are looking only for an example here.


- neuroConstruct_NetworkMLv1.8.1.h5  Padraig Gleeson
  
  A version of NetworkML (cell positions & connections only, no 
  morphologies/channels) in HDF5 as can be saved/loaded in to 
  neuroConstruct at tab Generate

- neuroConstruct_simulationDataOnePop.h5  Padraig Gleeson
  
  Traces of membrane potentials from a single population/cell group, as saved 
  during a NEURON simulation. Option to save as HDF5 (as opposed to simple text 
  files) is enables by selecting "Save data as HDF5" at tab NEURON
  
- Neuronvisio_medium_cell_example_10ms.h5   Michele Mattioni

  Example of a Neuronvisio HDF file. The file is described in details in this 
  page: http://neuronvisio.org/storage.html#hdf-structure
  Quick pick: 
    - geometry branch --> NeuroML 1.8.1 (here only a cell, but 
      theoretically can hold anything NeuroML can keep)
    - results branch --> Numpy array arranged according section_name/var_name

- neurohdf_microcircuit.hdf (June, 2012 by Stephan Gerhard)

  An example of how we currently export data from CATMAID to a NeuroHDF
  file containing geometric information of neuron morphologies (skeletons),
  and synapses. Everything is expressed as vertices and connectivity (edges),
  and properties on vertices and edges. Metadata contains semantic information,
  associating a skeleton id to a string expressing the path in the
  annotation hierarchy in CATMAID (object tree).
  
  We use this format to do neural circuit analysis (focusing on the anatomy)
  using the microcircuit package, including a loader:
  https://github.com/unidesigner/microcircuit/blob/master/examples/load_neurohdf.py
  
  For visualization we use Fos, the NeuroHDF microcircuit format can be loaded
  there, and microcircuits visualized:
  https://github.com/fos/fos/blob/master/examples/microcircuit_neurohdf.py
  
  I plan to wrap up the specification on www.neurohdf.org at some point:

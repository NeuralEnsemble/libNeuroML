def retrieve_coordinates():
    """
    Retrieves all the spatial coordinates from a NeuroML model and return 
    a dictionary with the segment_id as key and a list of the coordinates 
    for x, y and z axes, plus the diameter. 
    For example if Segment 1 has the point xyz_start = (1,2,3) and 
    xyz_stop = (5,6,7), with diameter_start=10 and diameter_end=20
    the return dictionary is:
    {
    1: [[1,5], [2,6], [3,7], [10,20]]
    }
    :rtype: dictionary: key=segment_id, value=(x, y, z, d), where x,y,z,d are 
    in the form x=[x_start, x_stop]..."""

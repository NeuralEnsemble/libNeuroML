Some tests for making a HDF5 backend for libNeuroML

Install the preliminary libNeuroML for python version in ../generatedFromV2Schema first...

Try:

python readCA1.py

This will read in an XML file (../../../testFiles/CA1.nml) with a CA1 cell morphology, and
write out the equivalent in a suggested HDF5 format

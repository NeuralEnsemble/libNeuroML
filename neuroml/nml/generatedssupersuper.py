        This is required because generally, in Python, if one passes a keyword
        argument that is not listed in a Class constructor, Python will error.
        However, in libNeuroML/nml.py, all constructors have a last keyword
        argument `**kwargs` which means extra keyword arguments that do not match
        the members are silently accepted and then ignored---because they are not
        used in the constructor.

        This means that common mistakes like typos will not be caught by Python,
        and in larger models, one will have to inspect the model in great detail to
        realise that a mistake has been made while creating a component from a
        NeuroML ComponentType.

    "# Use of NeuroML HDF5 serialisation format\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main serialisation format for NeuroML 2 is XML, but a serialisation form based on HDF5 is also supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantages of this are:\n",
    " \n",
    "- Models can be built with libNeuroML and saved automatically in this format ([code](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML/tree/master/neuroml/hdf5))\n",
    "- An identical format is used in the Java based libraries ([code](https://github.com/NeuroML/org.neuroml.model/tree/master/src/main/java/org/neuroml/model/util/hdf5))\n",
    "\n",
    "Note though:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Documentation at this time is minimal\n",
    "- The serialisation concentrates on efficient storage of network properties (cell positions, connections), rather than morphologies (this is not an issue if populations with multiple identical cells are used)\n",

* Outline of what's been done so far

** DONE Pyramidal can now interface with NEURON and MOOSE, hodgkin huxley channels are supported natively.

* LibNeuroML to do

** TODO Clearer documentation

* Pyramidal

** TODO Fix multi-compartmental issue (Padraig was right)
** TODO Right now, although components are loaded, only the morphology is being used by Pyramidal. You still can't have a Hodgkin huxley channel in neuroML seamlessly (from loading) be converted into NEURON and MOOSE, there is no real reason why not, I will do this.
** TODO More documentation

* General plan

** Roadmap document

** Automated tests

** Once the points above are done, look at ways of optimizing the code and go for a first stable release, renaming some things needs to happen.

* Questions

- Right now HH is a fully supported type.

- NineML?

- ROADMAP - important
